            As part of our outreach initiative, our talented student artists
            proudly shared their work with neighbouring schools. These
            collaborative showcases gave students a chance to connect, inspire
            one another, and celebrate creativity beyond the classroom. It was
            more than just an exhibition‚Äîit was a conversation between young
            artists, building confidence, community, and a shared love for the
            arts.

            Our student artists had the exciting opportunity to share their work
            with other local schools, proudly presenting their drawings,
            paintings, and digital pieces in a collaborative exhibition. But it
            wasn‚Äôt just about showcasing ‚Äî it was about connecting. They
            explored the artwork created by other students too, gaining fresh
            ideas, new perspectives, and plenty of inspiration. It was a
            creative exchange that encouraged feedback, friendship, and artistic
            growth.

            During our third event, students came together to curate a mini
            pop-up gallery inside the school library. They led tours, explained
            their creative process, and even hosted live demos! The buzz of
            excitement, curiosity, and support from peers made it a standout
            moment for everyone involved.
